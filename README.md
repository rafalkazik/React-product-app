#### :clapper: Check live version: **[LIVE](https://react-interview-starter-ts-rafalkazik.vercel.app/)**

This is my first project using TypeScript. I finally wanted to use it because so far I only used JavaScript.

The project doesn't include tests in React, because I am planning to learn them in the near future. I wanted to focus mainly on TypeScript.

## :gear: Installation

Let's start with installing all dependencies. Move to the app main workspace and run:

Our repositories search engine is ready at port 3000.
